## Multi-Language Script Flow

### Step 1 Generate Script Table (3 columns)

```
Generate a story about <TOPIC>, format output as a table with 3 column and 4 rows.

Follow these guidelines for the rows:
Make every row between 50 and 120 words long each, by adding details to the story. Do not add anything numbering to the paragraphs.

Follow these guidelines for the columns:
In the first column, place the story paragraph in <LANGUAGE1>.
In the second column, place the story paragraph in <LANGUAGE2>. 
In the third column, generate a prompt in English to be used in an AI image generation tool called Stable Diffusion.

Follow these guidelines for the image prompt column:
Use simple sentences in English, do not add unnecessary details like feelings and use the following format: <describe the subject of the image, what they are wearing, how many they are>, <describe the background of the scene>, <specify the time of day>
