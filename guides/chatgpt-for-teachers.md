# ChatGPT for Teachers

## Introduction

So much has been said recently about Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, and there has been a lot of conversations around how students could use it for classes and assignments. However, not a lot has been said about how instructors could leverage it to improve the quality of their content, save time, and prevent cheating. 

Let's start by defining what ChatGPT is and is not:

- ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool that can generate human-like text, including answers to questions, longer texts such as essays, and even complete conversations.
- ChatGPT is NOT a sentient or conscious entity. It is also NOT a replacement for human expertise or judgement, and it ma generate inaccurate or inappropriate content if not used correctly.

## Ok, so how does it work?

ChatGPT is a language model that uses unsupervised learning to predict the next word in a sequence of text.

1. During training, ChatGPT is presented with large amounts of text data and adjusts the weights of its connections to learn patterns and relationships in language.
2. Once trained, ChatGPT can generate text by being prompted with a starting phrase or sentence.
3. ChatGPT uses the patterns and relationships it learned during training to generate text that is semantically and syntactically similar to human language.
4. The key to ChatGPT's effectiveness is its ability to learn from large amounts of text data, enabling it to generate natural-sounding and human-like text.

Basically, ChatGPT takes our prompt via text, utilizes its trained model to predict the most appropriate response, and follows given language rules and patterns to output a coherent response.

## What are the benefits?

Overall, the benefits of ChatGPT for professors include time-saving, customization, reduced risk of cheating, and consistency, which can lead to a more efficient and effective teaching experience.

1. Time-saving: ChatGPT can generate high-quality course materials, such as quizzes, lab templates, and practical exam instructions, in a matter of minutes, which can save professors a significant amount of time.
2. Customization: ChatGPT allows professors to customize the generated content to fit their specific needs, ensuring that the course materials are tailored to the course's learning objectives.
3. Reduced risk of cheating: By using ChatGPT to generate exercises, quizzes, and tests, professors can add more variance to their questions and minimize the risk of students sharing materials from previous semesters or external platforms.
4. Consistency: ChatGPT can help ensure consistency in course materials, especially when teaching the same course over multiple semesters, by generating similar content that adheres to the course's learning objectives and rubrics.

In short, the main benefits could be summarized as a single word: TEMPLATES. It provides high quality, highly customizable, difficult to replicate, and consistent templates. Additionally, content generation is really quick so the cost of customizing by rewording, reordering or just creating an alternate version of something is reduced drastically.

## Use Case - How did I use it?

Every semester, I mainly deal with two issues:

- Cheating: This is something that all instructors must be aware of. Students from one semester can upload PDFs for assignments, answers to quizzes, and exam questions to sites such as Course Hero. Students from the next semesters might be able to get access to solutions and exam questions.
- Creating Consistent and High Quality content is extremely time consuming: This applies to my quizzes, assignments, and exams. I also would want to keep them updated, and with enough variation to prevent cheating.

I turned to ChatGPT and decided to try using it to help me solve my problems above. Here are the steps I followed:

### Setting the goal

I decided to update my quizzes with better questions. I wanted to create 4 new quizzes to use in one of my classes.

### Generating questions

I started by asking ChatGPT a simple prompt:

> As a Software Engineer specialized in XYZ technology, generate a 10-question quiz that cover topics A, B, and C.

To which, ChatGPT generated a good response. Question, then answer, then question, then answerâ€¦ That's exactly what I wanted but in terms of format it was difficult to read, and even more difficult to bring over to my LMS platform. Luckily, ChatGPT can also be asked to provide outputs in a particular format, so I modified my prompt:

> As a Software Engineer specialized in XYZ technology, generate 10 quiz questions that cover topics A, B, and C. Format your response as a table.

This time ChatGPT generated a table with two columns, one for answer and one for response. However, I wanted to make it a multiple-choice quiz. So I changed my prompt once more:

> As a Software Engineer specialized in XYZ technology, generate 10 quiz questions that cover topics A, B, and C. Questions should be in multiple-choice format, and please provide which one is the a Format your response as a table.

Now the response was better. A single table, first column was the question number, second column had the question, third column contained the options.

### Reviewing Questions and Answers

With all this information being generated, it's very important for the instructor to be in the pilot seat. As mentioned above, ChatGPT might generate inaccurate and inappropriate information some times. Therefore, and as a rule of thumb, always review its responses.

Adjust its responses according to your own content, the examples you use in class, maybe there are topics that have more weight than others for you.

In my case, it contained almost all correct questions. I had to adjust only a couple of them:

- One was about when the tech stack used in class was originally released. ChatGPT mentioned 2001 but the official documentation says January 2002. So which was it? It wasn't wrong entirely. Since 2001 was the year when it was announced. I decided to stick with the official documentation for this as it's also aligned with my content.

- Another one mentioned the incorrect startup file for a project. Which is to be expected since ChatGPT's cutoff knowledge date is somewhere in 2021 and I was generating questions about a technology that was released in later in that year and project templates were changed.

After detecting these mistakes I decided to move on to the LMS platform to create my quizzes.

### Creating a Quiz in the LMS platform

As I created the quiz and starting adding questions and answers, I realized I also wanted to provide feedback to my students.

### Adjusting the already generated

Another really great thing about ChatGPT is that it remembers the context of the conversation you are having. In this case, instead of asking it to generate another table, I just asked it to add columns to it with another prompt:

> Regenerate the table above, and add two more columns. One with recommended feedback for when the answer is wrong, and another one with links to references to the official documentation.

Now I had a version of the table with links to references that I could attach to my feedback to direct students to the official recommendation so they can read further about those questions they get wrong.

### Review and Wrap-Up

After one last review of the feedback and links provided, I went back to the LMS platform to complete my quiz.

## What do I think I gained?

By following the steps above, I now have the ability to generate quizzes that are different. I can go back to ChatGPT and ask it to reword the questions. In theory I have the ability to provide unlimited versions of high quality materials, reducing the risk of cheating, and allowing me to dedicate more time to more higher value tasks.

## Conclusion

All in all it took me about 20 mins per quiz. I could have spent longer deciding on the questions and wording them. And at the end of the day I would have come up with similar questions, but the advantage of being able to generate a new version of one of my quizzes so fast is definitely an advantage. With the extra time, I can focus on giving better and more thoughtful feedback on assignments, and exams. 

As instructors, we are knowledge workers, and our currency is time. The less time we spend on repetitive tasks, more time we can put on activities that provide higher value to our students. Like a proper code review in my case. ChatGPT gives us templates, and it's essential to remember that we need to be on the pilot seat and drive that endeavor forward.
