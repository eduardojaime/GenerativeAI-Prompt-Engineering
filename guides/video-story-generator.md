# Video Story Generation


## Single Language Script Flow
### Step 1 Generate a Story

Prompt - Generate a Story Draft

```
Generate a story about <TOPIC>, format output as a table with 1 column and 12 rows.
The first row, explaining in one sentence the topic of the story.
The last row, thanking the audience for listening and inviting them to subscribe and like the video.
Add a lot of detail to each paragraph, paragraphs 2 to 11 must be about 150 words long. Do not add anything extra like numbering to the paragraphs.
```

### Step 2.1 Generate img prompt for Stable Diffusion

Prompt - Adding a column that contains an image prompt

```
Add a new column to the table.
In the first column, place the story paragraph. 
In the second column, generate a prompt to be used in an AI image generation tool called Stable Diffusion.
For the story paragraph, don't shorten the story, you can make a longer paragraph to include the original version.
For the image prompt use the following format: <describe the subject of the image, what they are wearing, how many they are>, <describe the background of the scene>, <specify the time of day>
For the image prompt use simple sentences in English and do not add unnecessary details like feelings.
Keep the table size as 12 rows plus headers.
