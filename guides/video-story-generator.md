In the second column, generate a prompt to be used in an AI image generation tool called Stable Diffusion.
For the story paragraph, don't shorten the story, you can make a longer paragraph to include the original version.
For the image prompt use the following format: <describe the subject of the image, what they are wearing, how many they are>, <describe the background of the scene>, <specify the time of day>
For the image prompt use simple sentences and do not add unnecessary details like feelings.
